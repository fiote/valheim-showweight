# CONFIGURATION 

You can config the text to be displayed in different positions on your screen. You can change the mod's configuration in three distinct ways:

1) Edit the /BepInEx/config/fiote.mods.showweight.cfg file on any text editor.
2) Use some mod to edit those values ingame (ex: Configuration Manager).
3) Use console commands to change them (see below).

# CONSOLE COMMANDS
